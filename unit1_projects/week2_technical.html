			<h2>Margins, Borders, and Padding - A Demystification</h2>

			<p>If you're like me, at one point or another you have been confused about the difference between margins, borders, and padding. But sometimes all you need are visual aids to put things in perspective. <br>

			<div id="padding">
				<h3>Padding</h3>
				<p>Let's start with the padding. The padding is a sort of insulation between the content and the border. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="margins">
				<h3>Margins</h3>
				<p>Margins, as they are in word processors are the space from the border to the adjacent edge. Often this is the edge of the web page, but not necessarily always.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="borders">
				<h3>Borders</h3>
				<p>The border is the definite boundary around the content, nested between the padding and the margin. It is often the most concrete and recognizable of the three.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="conclusion">
				<h3>What Now?</h3>
				<p>In the end, your site will have a diagram that roughly looks like the following.  This particular diagram is specific to this page, so yours will likely look different.  Depending on what you choose to do with your site, you will likely have individual elements with their own margins, borders, and padding as well.</p>
