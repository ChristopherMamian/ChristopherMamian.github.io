			<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1><br>


<p>According to social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele, one of the major barriers holding back the achievement of black people, women and other underrepresented groups is a phenomenon he calls “stereotype threat,” the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. I only recently have learned about stereotype threat and its role in the achievement gap, but I see how it can have meaningful effects on the self-confidence of groups who have negative stereotypes 
attached to them. </p><br>

<p>A little background about myself. I went to a majority white high school. Being Armenian-American, I myself identify as a person of color, particularly in the summer, when I am a few shades too dark to pass the brown paper bag test. I would often be asked the classic questions such as "Where are you from?," or "What are you?," despite being born in Los Angeles and identifying predominately as an American. Over the years, I have become aware that I do not fit into the mold of being white; that I am "ethnic."</p><br>

<p>With this dual-identity, I find myself always trying to find the balance between assimilation and being the "other." It follows me through my different life experiences. When I am talking to women, when I discuss my family around others, down to the music I play and the food I eat in public. The last thing I want to do is fill a negative stereotype in someone else's head, particularly when they often do not have meaningful experiences to draw from. This carries a particular burden in the back of my mind that for the most part I do a good job of keeping from the forefront.</p><br>

<p>My experience in college was a different one. The most represented ethnic group were Asians. Taking math classes which are graded on a curve, most students would count the number of Asians they were competing against. When the white students underperformed, their most common response was "Of course! Just look at this classroom!"</p><br>

<p>Fortunately, there are not specific stereotypes regarding my intelligence or competence, but I can
see how if there were, it could very well be a self-fulfilling prophecy. While not as privileged as some others, I am definitely privileged not having a legacy to compete against.</p><br>
