<h2>How to Ask Questions</h2>

<p>One of my first weeks at DBC, I enountered a problem with GitHub. Through the grace of my own brilliance, I zapped away my blog posts and images for the week. Being new to Github, I hoped I could ask the community for help.</p><br>

<p>What I did not really have a grasp for was how to go about it. I offered no clear example of what I did, my query was excessively vague, and I did not have a short title or summary for the reader to quickly scope before to determine if he or she could help me. I definitely did not make it easy for them.</p><br>

<p>To make it easier for them, I should be very specific, provide examples of code, and make it very readable. It should let the, know what they are getting into and if it is something they can help with, from the beginning.</p><br>
