<h2>Avoidance and How to Deal With It</h2>

<p>Whenever I feel unappreciated, I just shut down. Sometimes, with my ex-girlfriend, I would put in effort that would go unreciprocated and I would close myself off. I go quiet and emotionless, only responding in single words. We call this "The Void." Once I am in the Void, it is difficult to get out, only after a few hours. Needless to say, this made things awkward and terrible for everyone involved.</p><br>

<p>In my interpersonal relationships, I manifest my shame as Avoidance, which is one response to shame on what is known as the Compass of Shame. I procrastinate and keep putting off finding resolutions to my problems until the last possible moment. The goal of avoidance is to hide the feelings of shame from consciousness entirely if possible. Anytime I did not want to confront my problems, I would simply avoid them and turn to alcohol and cigarettes. Drowning the problems and postponing confrontation to later would always be my preferred course of action.</p><br>

<p>Sometimes, as an outward approach to people, Avoidance manifests as narcissism. I can often be very boastful or exhibitionistic, trying to distract from my avoidance and direct attention elsewhere. This is often fueled by alcohol and is to avoid intimacy. </p><br>

<p>If I could go back to my interactions with my girlfriend, I would breath and push myself to confront the issues. Lately, I have been meditating and I find it helps me clear my mind and prevents avoidance. More than ever, I feel in control of my being. If I just breath and approach things step by step, there is nothing I cannot do. </p><br>
