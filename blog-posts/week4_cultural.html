		<h2>Techin our jabs</h2>
			<p>A particular problem within the world of tech is the growing income inequality it causes. Indeed, this problem is not limited to within tech - it affects all of us.</p><br>

<p>We are witnessing an age of innovation potentially unprecedented throughout human history. Internet data keeps exploding exponentially. Children today will never know a time without the internet, when all of human knowledge was not available at their fingertips. We are approaching the event horizon. It is impossible to say what will be possible in 20 years time.</p><br>

<p>Low-skilled labor is becoming obsolete. We are engineering robots, processes, and apps to make lives easier and labor less necessary. But in the short term, the poor and less educated will suffer. In a sense, this is a good thing. After all, we increase human wealth while lowering human effort. But the financial rewards are not shared by all, but by those that are educated - the elite. </p><br>

<p>Technology is creating greater wealth that comes with greater economic inequality. San Francisco has now become widely known as a city for the rich. Property value and cost of living is now so astronomical that the working class cannot afford to live there without considerable subsidies or tax benefits. Who will be left to check us out at the grocery store or operate our public transit. Of course, inevitably we will automate these jobs and eliminate them entirely, but then how is the working class to work for a living? </p><br>

<p>Education has now become more valuable than ever before. The good news is, there is no shortage of avenues or resources to learn. In the past, it was near essential to go to university because they were the only game in town if you wanted to educate yourself. Now you can learn and network online. While universities still have prestige and social value, the rightly motivated individual can learn just as much without financial and opportunity costs associated with a traditional brick and morter school. </p><br>

<p>As access has opened up to education, the costs of not doing so have as well. In the education-driven economy, the rich and priveleged are advantaged, while those of more modest backgrounds will be left behind if not helped to succeed.</p><br>

<p>In the coming decades, I suspect the only way to prevent massive civil unrest is to ensure a minimum living. Hopefully affordable housing and food will be budgeted for everyone, and the rich taxed appropriately. If this occurs and goes smoothly, we may just be closer than ever to a post-labor era, where people can really follow their passions in life rather than worrying about providing for themselves.</p><br>
