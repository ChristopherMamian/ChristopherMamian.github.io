 		<h2>Cristobal goes to DBC</h2>
 		<h3>What I expect from Dev Bootcamp</h3>
 	</header>

 		<p>DBC seems like a cult of techno super-hippies. In a good way. Its refreshing that there is an emphasis on the human element, through engineering empathy and emotional intelligence. The Fireside Chat with Shereef matched what I have come to expect from the experience. I work best in collaborative enviornments where my interpersonal skills can make the difference between things running smoothly or dragging along.
 			<br>
 			<br>I'm very excited to rise to the opportunity DBC provides. I know there will be times where I will want to pull my hair out and bang my head against the wall, but those moments come and go. The journey is ever-forward, one step at a time.
