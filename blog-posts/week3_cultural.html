			<p>	Aside from the coding itself, a lot of emphasis is given at DBC to culture and personal development. As part of our development, we are asked to take a quiz and discover our Gregorc Thinking style.</p><br>

My thinking style is known as concrete random, which can be described as a practical dreamer. I am great at experimenting and trouble-shooting, but I have trouble finishing my projects, which I can leave to start others.  I am very hands-on and creative, but can have trouble following authority, preferring instead to do things at my own pace in my own way.</p><br>

So far during Phase 0 at DBC, my biggest struggle has been procrastination. I spend the first couple days of the week reading the materials and dipping my feet into the challenges, then over the next few days I partially complete most of the challenges.</p><br>

In my mind I am always thinking "I am done with Challenge 2, except for this and this," which of course means I am not done! Then come Sunday, I am cramming to get everything done by midnight. It is not pleasant putting myself through that anxiety, and if I can work on my procrastination, I can space out my learning and get more out of the challenges I am sure.</p><br>

On way I can combat this problem is I can agree to not move onto the next challenge until each part of the previous challenge is done. That means each release and the reflection. This will give me a more accurate assessment of where I am and how much I have completed. The way I have been doing things thus far misleads me into thinking I have done more than I have and leads to my suffering on Sunday.</p><br>

Part of the growth mindset is identifying my weaknesses and believing I can improve upon them with effort. I know what my shortcomings are, and while it is not easy to change old habits, I am not destined to be stuck with them.</p><br>
