			<h2>Why Javascript?</h2>


<p>So you want to learn JavaScript? Excellent choice. There is much to love about the language and it will be a worthy addition to your development arsenal. Here's why!</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Popular and versatile. It is everywhere and is known as the programming language of the web.</li>
<li>Every browser supports Javascript on the client side, but you can also use it to run server side code</li>
<li>Runs fast and on the client side, which puts less strain on the server.</li>
<li>Can be used within Java and C++</li>
<li>Known to be relatively easy to learn</li>
<li>Very large community willing to help</li>
<li>Plenty of libraries and frameworks - No need to reinvent the wheel. There are plenty of ways designed to make what you are trying to do easier.</li>
</ul>
There are some limitations to JavaScript however. Because it runs in the browser, JS cannot write to files on the server or access databases without using a server side script such as Ajax.

Javascript, being limited to the web page itself, also cannot access files on the client computer, other than cookies. This is for security purposes.

Still, despite these shortcomings, Javascript is popular enough, useful enough, and easy enough to learn. So get out there and hack away!
