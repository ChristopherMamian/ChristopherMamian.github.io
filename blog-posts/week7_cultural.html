<p>Inner Harmony. No external pleasures can be enjoyed if you are off center within. Your inner harmony is the foundation which you can build your empire on.</p><br>

<p>The last topic I was asked for advice on was career advice, asked by my girlfriend.</p><br>

<p>When I think about my values, I think about how driven I am to change my circumstances and start out on this new career. I think my values allow me to mitigate stereotype threat when I feel confident in my abilities. It will take time, but I will have to get more comfortable with what I am doing as a programmer before I can work past stereotype threat.</p><br>

<p>Literal excercise can definitely keep my spirits up. It is very difficult for me to feel too upset or stressed out when I am making sure I am excercising and keeping my body in shape.</p><br>
