 		<h3>My favorite sites</h3>
 	</header>

 		<p><strong>Facebook</strong><br>
 			Facebook. We're all familiar with it. The hub of social consumption on the internet. As soon as you log in your eye is locked on either the news feed down the middle or the bright red notifications up top.
 			<br>
 			The site is clean, if cluttered lately with all sorts of whatchamacallit to make you invest more time into it. What was once a very simple design is now saturated with information and advertisements at every corner.
 			<br> Facebook is intended to keep you connected with your friends and as a service keeps you informed of how much happier everyone else in your life is. The content for the most part is unnecessary to your survival as a human being, which meshes nicely with its design as an all-you-can consume extravaganza. Common emotions experienced after exposure to Facebook include isolation, sadness, loneliness, and inadequacy. 
 			<br>There's a search bar at the top to creep on all your favorite (or least favorite) people. The news feed and the notifications direct you towards possible points of interest. Information about you is gathered and ads are directed toward you in the form of sponsored stories on your news feed and on the side panel. Naturally, Facebook knows me well, and recommends events I really like, and occasionally attend.</p>

 		
 		<p><strong>Dark Roasted Blend</strong><br>Dark Roasted Blend is a collection of galleries of all sorts of cool, strange, bizarre, and beautiful places, things, and stories from around the world. Upon visiting the homepage, your eye is guided to the surreal, beautiful thumbnails just waiting to be clicked to send you on your way to adventure. But upon standing back away from the screen, you notice the prominence of the logo at the top left.
 		<br>Visually, the site itself is somewhat bland. Aside from the whimsical photos, the background, layout, and text on screen is antiquated with no frills. It relies on the photos to fascinate you.
 		<br> If you are looking for a particular array of collections, there are links on the homepage to view galleries pertaining to "nature," "technology," "space," and so forth. If you are looking for something particular, you will likely have a tough time with it as there is no search bar.
 		<br>After being on the site for a while, occasionally you feel you have learned something, as you would by time travelling to the past or visiting another part of the world. However, as more pressing matters catch up with you, it may just feel as if you've wasted your time. 
 		<br> Dark Roasted Blend sells advertising space, which pays for the awesome experience. I cannot say if I've purchased anything from those ads.


 		 </p>
 		<p><strong>Codecademy</strong><br>Codecademy is a great site for learning how to code. However, the most recent design leaves me frustrated. A large portion of the background is completely white, which overwhelms the eyes and makes the page feel very empty. The eyes are lead to clickable colored buttons to send you to tutorials for Ruby, Javascript, HTML, and other languages.
 			<br> Its easy to navigate around the site and find the forums, find different tutorials, and check your profile and the points you have earned.</p>
