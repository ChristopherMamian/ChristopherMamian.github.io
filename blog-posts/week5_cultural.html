			<h1>Peer Programming and Feedback</h1>
<h3> What Has Pair Programming Been Like?</h3><br>

<p>Pair programming has been a great experience mostly. For one, it is so great to meet my fellow boots not just from Chicago, but all over the country and elsewhere. I feel the networking component of it alone makes it all worth it. But also, it is incredibly humbling encountering someone who knows more than you, and can be a very rich experience when you are teaching someone that might no less about certain topics.</p><br>


<p>A frustrating part of the whole pairing process can be communicating to your pair what you are thinking or trying to do. Coding thus far is a relatively new skill for us, with tons of new concepts and even methods of thinking. It can be difficult to wrap you head around things in the comfort of your own head. But when you are forced to communicate it to another person who may have differing understandings of these working concepts, things can get complicated.</p><br>


<h3>Feedback</h3><br>

<p>I will be honest - I do not take criticism as well as I would like. My ego can be sensitive when learning something as new and as challenging as programming. The little voice inside my head wants to scream out "I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN, GET OFF MY BACK!!" It tries to convince me that all I need is more time, and I will figure it out on my own and become an expert with just more practice. This can needlessly hamper progress.</p><br>

<p>Thus far, I feel like the feedback comments mostly tell me what I already suspect about myself and there has been nothing that has taught me something I do not know. A common criticism is that I can go quiet when researching a topic and there are periods of silence where my pair is unsure what I am doing. This can be remedied easily with just some more vocalization.</p><br>

<p>Writing feedback has been a little tough at times. Most of my pairs are very awesome people that are putting in the effort and are just struggling to make sense of all this. It can be difficult to nitpick when they do so much right and the only thing missing is experience.</p><br>

<p>Overall, I am loving pairing so far and there is no doubt in my mind that it helps accelerate my learning. Thanks DBC for encouraging us to learn this essential skillset!</p><br>
