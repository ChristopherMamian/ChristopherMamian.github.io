			<h1>Fun With Classes</h1>
<p>In the world of Object Oriented programming, classes and objects model real-world objects intuitively.</p><br>

<p>All objects in a class are grouped together with similar object attributes. Instance methods within that class relate to the things that can be done by that specific class or group of objects.</p><br>

<p>Say I want to replicate professional skateboarders in Ruby. We would have a class known as Skateboarders. From there, I can make an instance of a class and call it Rodney Mullen. A particular skateboarder can be made from the Skateboarder class, which acts as a template, with attributes shared by skateboarders.</p><br>

<p>From there, we can have instance methods such as #ollie or #kickflip. Every instance of the Skateboarder class will be able to use these instance methods.</p><br>

<p>Classes contain information about attributes and methods. The first step is to define the initialize class, which creates the object. It accepts arguments that allow you to pass info about your object, such as height, nationality, and skateboard brand. These arguments can be saved as instance variables which can be accessed by the rest of the Class. Similarly, insance methods can be used by objects throughout the class.</p><br>

<p>Hope classes make a bit more sense now!</p><br>
