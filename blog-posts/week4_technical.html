			<h1>Fun With Loops</h1>

<p>Oftentimes as we are programming, we will need to use loops. However, as one quickly discovers, there are many ways to loop and each has its advantages and particular functionality.</p><br>



<h3>While Loop</h3><br>

<p>The first loop in our Ruby toolkit is the while loop. As long as the conditional statement is met, while loops will execute their statements.</p>

<h3>Until Loop</h3><br>

<p>Until loops act as an inverse of the while loop. As long as the conditional statement is false, the statements within the until loop will execute.</p>

<h3>Times Loop</h3><br>

<p>Times loops can be used on any variable containing a number or used on a number itself. If you pass 6 as the input, it will run 6 times.</p>

<h3>Each Loop</h3><br>

<p>Perhaps the most useful loop. It will take a list of variables and run a block of statements for each of them. Almost all computing tasks use lists of variables and have to do something with each of them in the list, so the each loop is the most common in Ruby.</p>
